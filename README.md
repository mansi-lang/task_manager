Task Manager is a simple and efficient web application built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks from a single dashboard. It includes secure user authentication, responsive design for mobile and desktop, and task status tracking to mark tasks as complete or pending. The project uses a MySQL database (via XAMPP) for storing user and task data, making it ideal for learning full stack development basics and CRUD operations.
